This is an example of the extraction for coastal profiles in flume experiments.

Step 1: 'sandbar profile'
Run the 'm' files in the folders of '01-initial' profile and '02-characteristic' profile, respectively.
The files of 'data-m0' and 'data-m1' in the folder of 'erosion and deposition' can be obtained, respectively.

Step 2: 'lagoon-dune profile'
The same process as the above Step 1. 
The files of 'data-r0' and 'data-r1' in the folder of 'erosion and deposition' can be obtained, respectively.

Step 3: 'erosion and deposition'
Run the 'm' file. Specific characteristic parameters of sediment transport can be obtained.
